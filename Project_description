# Time series forecasting
## Project 1: Research and report on automl-based methods for time series forecasting
and implementation of functions
## Priority / Cut-out ease
- Priority: High
- Easy to cut out: High
- Difficulty: Medium
### Purpose
- I have an automated time series forecasting analysis tool that I am currently developing.
I am considering using automl-based methods as part of this function.
- In this project, we will perform the following two tasks
- 1) Survey of methods
- Investigate automl-based methods and libraries for time series forecasting, and summarize the outline of the methods and libraries in a document.
and summarize the outline of the methods and libraries in a document.
- 2) Implementation of the model
- Learn an automl model for the specified input data, and create a function that returns the model, forecast data for verification, and future forecast data.
Implement a function that returns the model, validation prediction data, and future prediction data.
### Task Details: 1) Researching methods
#### To do.
- [ ] List up automl-based methods for time series forecasting. When listing them, summarize what they are in about one line.
When listing them, summarize what they are in about one line.
- [ ] Pick up 5 of the listed ones that look good.
- [ ] For each of them, write a rough overview of the library at intervals of about one a day, with at least the following items.
For each of them, write a rough summary of the library at least once a day. The summary will be published on the company's blog called [Hakky Handbook](https://book.st-hakky.com/).
The summary will be published on our blog [Hakky Handbook](), so please prepare for that as well.

### Task Details: 2) Implement the model
#### Things to do.
- [ ] Implement a function that learns automl and outputs prediction results for a given input.
- [ ] The function should be a single function.
- [ ] Google Colab is assumed to be the working environment. This includes the installation of libraries, etc.
[ ] "Task Details: 1) Methodology
- [ ] Implement the function using the library studied in "Task Details: 1) Methodology Study".
#### Specifications
- Input data (to be provided at the time of work)
- As Output, return the model, prediction data for validation, and future prediction data.
#### Estimated duration
- 2 weeks

- 2-4 weeks.
# Text-based
## Project 1: Investigation and validation of methods for document summarization systems.
## Priority / Cut-out ease
- Priority: High
- Ease of extraction: High
- Difficulty: Medium
## Objective.
- We have an automated analysis tool that we are currently developing, and we are considering adding a document summarization feature as part of this feature.
We are considering to add document summarization function as a part of this tool.
- In this project, we will perform the following two tasks
- 1) Investigation of methods
- To investigate methods and libraries for document summarization, and to summarize the outline of the methods and libraries in a document.
2) Implementation of the method
- 2) Implementation of the method
- Implement a function that returns the summarized data when the text data to be summarized is input.
- As for the research of methods, some of them are still being researched, and we would like to share them as needed.
### Task Details: 1) Research methods
#### Things to do
- [ ] Make a list of methods for document summarization. When you list them, describe what they are in about one line.
summarize what they are.
- [ ] Pick up five of the listed ones that seem to be good.
- [ ] For each of them, write a rough overview of the library at intervals of about one a day, with at least the following items.
